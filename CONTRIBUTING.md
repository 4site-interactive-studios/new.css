Thanks for helping build new.css! When contributing, here are the general guidelines to follow.

- Update the primary file `new.css` first. I like to comment inline how/why any chanegs are made, so please try to add a comment about what the change does and why it's helpful.
- Minify the code using https://csscompressor.com on the 'Highest' setting, and update `new.min.css` with the code.
- To make `lite.css`, remove the font-face `@import` in the beginning.

And you're ready to submit!
